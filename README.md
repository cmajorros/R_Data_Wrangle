# R_Data_Wrangle
This project is aimed to getting to know R and how to manipulate the data with R. I collected the commands that seems to be very useful
and mostly used. As a data analyst, I have done many projects which related data cleaning and data preparation. 

This project consists of 3 parts; 
1) All about data set : it shows how to manipulate the data set. It mainly about CRUD of Vector, Data frame
2) R_Data_Wrangle : This shows how to use functions which related to date, character and how to calulate the number 
3) importDataset_Database: it shows how to import the data with different types of files and how to connect to database.
